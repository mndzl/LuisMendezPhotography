            <p>
            Hey! I am Luis. I am a Venezuelan Native and currently living in <b>Kissimmee, Florida</b>. I moved to the United States with many dreams and goals to reach.
            <br><br>
            Shortly after, I became a Disney Photographer where I was introduced to the art of taking <b>story-telling images</b>.
            <br><br>
            Today, I work with industry leaders at Disneyâ€™s Fine Art Photography, ESPN GameDay Sports and my own photography brand, <b>Luis Mendez Photography</b>.
